      <p>We frequently discuss how important evaluation, comments, and grading are to both teaching effectiveness and student learning. Furthermore, why not? It's an important intersection that has to be explored and debated in order to keep getting better.
        Examining our past is crucial in order to understand where our current grading system originated and to inform future innovations. It's also critical to consider the rationale behind the current grading schemes.
        Since the exchange of knowledge between students and teachers has always been at the heart of education, assessment is nothing new—it has been practiced for centuries. By methodically analyzing student learning patterns to guide future instruction, assessment aims to enhance student learning.

        <p>Grading is a subcategory of assessment that measures the learning of each individual student. Since the idea of grading is relatively new, letter grades, evaluative and numerical grading, and grading on a curve are all relatively new in the field of education. The 1940s saw the widespread adoption of letter grades. In actuality, letter grades were only utilized in 67% of US primary and secondary schools as late as 1971.
            How then did we arrive here? And why?
            The initial student evaluations did not include letter or number grades. Assessments were not utilized as evaluative but rather as formative learning aids by the ancient Greeks. 
            Exit exams were mandated by Harvard in 1646 for degree completion. Furthermore, the first American grading system was established in 1785 by Yale president Ezra Stiles, and it was based on four descriptions: Optimi, Second Optimi, Inferiores, and Perjores. Similar strategies were used in 1817 by other universities, such as William and Mary. These grading schemes emerged concurrently with the UK; researchers theorized that these systems are a worldwide phenomenon, concluding that “teachers such as Stiles appear to have been copying a classification scheme best exemplified by the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos examination,” which assessed student learning (Schneider & Hutt, 2014). 
            Even so, many of these schools concealed the grades from the students in order to prevent a competitive atmosphere that would divert attention from the lessons being taught (Schinske & Tanner, 2014).

            Educators like Horace Mann expressed concern about the competitive message that grading conveys to children and how it may impact their learning and intellectual growth. In his ninth annual report, Mann stated that students may prioritize exam results "as to incur moral hazards and delinquencies." For as long as there has been grading, there has been discussion on its benefits.
        However, in the early 1900s, grading changed from its holistic roots to a more standardized, objective, and scale-based approach as American schooling tripled in size, partly as a result of K–12 compulsory education. As a result, the requirement for a single system made effective and uniform communication throughout academic institutions a top priority. Grades were no longer tied to a particular college or university. Grades had to mean something to other parties and could no longer be tied to a single student. And grades scattered widely.
        The 4.0 scale and the 100 percent system were the two other grading schemes that would eventually be combined with the A-F system to form "the dominant grading scheme" by the 1940s (Schneider & Hutt, 2014). Letter and numerical grades were here to stay. Grading on a curve and establishing grades in relation to cohorts became popular in large, introductory STEM courses in higher education. Actually, the goal of grading on the curve was to reduce the degree to which grading was subjective (Guskey, 1994). As of right now, we know that curve grading also fuels student competition and could unjustly benefit individuals involved in academic dishonesty.
        The foundation of the present A-F or numerical grading system is less about enhancing student learning and more about expediting communication between academic institutions. Although grades can serve as a motivator for high achievers (how many teachers have been asked to regrade students?), there is still room for improvement. Students are more likely to turn to shortcuts when they are more concerned with their grades than with the real learning process. Furthermore, a recent EdSurge post by Tim Klein suggests that giving grades without offering feedback may be damaging to students' motivation. Student learning is not advanced by grades alone. "Grades can have a beneficial effect on student learning, but only when accompanied by specific or individualized comments from the teacher," according to research by Ellis Page (Guskey, 1994).
